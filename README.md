A course offer from [Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js-vi/info) taught by [Case Reas](http://reas.com/), [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/) and [Chandler McWilliams](http://brysonian.com/).

## Course description
Is an introductory programming course to explore the potential of the visual arts into the context of technology.

*...this course aspires to teach you to engage the computer more directly with code. Programming opens the possibility to create not only tools, but systems, environments, and new modes of expression. It is here that the computer ceases to be a tool and becomes a medium (KADENZE).*

I have already other version of the course in [processing](https://github.com/elohimgv/programming-for-visual-arts-processing-version).
